This creates additional composite adhesion points, which are securely adhered to the substrate. Instead of fixing six dowels per square metre through the insulation material as before, the Baumit thermal insulation composite system is adhered on six KlebeAnker fittings per square metre. The high-quality Baumit adhesive makes an important contribution to the function of the Baumit KlebeAnker Orange in the system.","experts_advice_3":"Data: Anchoring depth: in load-bearing substrate: \u2265 40 mm, in porous concrete: \u2265 65 mm, Shaft length: 88 mm, Borehole depth: at least 95 mm, Rate of product consumption: approx. 6 StarTrack Orange fittings per m\u00b2","experts_advice":"Use: Position the Baumit StarTrack Orange on the surface, covering a maximum area of 40 x 40 centimetres, a maximum of 10 centimetres horizontally from the base profile and vertically from the building edges. Mark the pattern, for example using a chalk line or an anchor plumb line. The Baumit StarTrack Orange must be positioned on the load-bearing substrate.
