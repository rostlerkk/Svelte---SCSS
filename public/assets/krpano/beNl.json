montagesnelheid (snellere, kortere schroef) en nieuw ontwikkelde multi-spreidzone. Ankerlengten 115\u2013295 mm Verankeringsdiepte: 25 mm (gebruikscategorie A-D), 45 mm (gebruikscategorie E) Ondergronden: Beton, volle baksteen, geperforeerde baksteen, kalkzandsteen, holle blokken, lichtbeton met open structuur, cellenbeton.   Toepassing:  1. Voor dieper verzinken van de ankers met het opzetwerktuig in het isolatiemateriaal EPS (vanaf isolatiedikte 80 mm), MineralTherm Echt plus 035 (vanaf isolatiedikte 100\u00a0mm) bzw. MineralTherm Echt 035 (vanaf isolatiedikte 120 mm). Anker wordt tijdens de montage (kortere montagetijd) automatisch in het isolatiemateriaal getrokken. Aansluitend afsluiten met rondel S.  2. Voor montage van de ankers gelijk met het oppervlak in alle gebruikelijke isolatiematerialen en voor de houtvezel-systeem op massieve bouw. Combineerbaar met de ankerschotels SBL 140 plus, VT 90 resp. VT 2G. Montage gebeurt alleen met verstelstang en TORX-bit T30, aansluitend Verschlusselement S plaatsen.  3. Montage van de ankers in cellenbeton, plaatsingsdiepte van 45 mm
